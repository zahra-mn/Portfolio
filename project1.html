                    The project was part of a five-year digital
                    transformation strategy in the Building Engineering
                    Organization, the official organization responsible for
                    construction in that province. The overall program
                    provided digital web platform, dashboards, and
                    various automation of processes and processes to
                    internally streamline operations. 
                    <br /><br />
                    Our focus was a mobile solution in the form of field 
                    supervision reports and to relieve manual processes,
                    wireless data inputs, and delays in reporting. This 
                    module would help enable real-time reporting no 
                    matter where the project was, covering not only 
                    accurate reporting from job sites, but also verification 
                    of safety and regulations.

                    We identified a core problem in the needs assessment stage;
                    legal obligations require supervisors to perform physical
                    site inspections. Yet there were a few challenges related to
                    physical inspections:

                    <p class="mb-4">
                      1. Possibility of false reporting without someone actually
                      visiting the site.

                    <p class="mb-4">
                      2. Duplication of reporting (first on a paper version and
                      then in the system) was wasted time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      3. There was no transparency for the owner of a building
                      that couldn't be able to verify if site visits occurred.

                    We conducted some brainstorming sessions with the
                    stakeholders of the project and the UX team based on the
                    user interviews, workflow analysis, and pain points. During
                    these sessions, we generated ideas that addressed the three
                    main areas of accuracy, trust, and ease-of-use, using "How
                    Might We" questions to get the ideas flowing. We did some
                    journey mapping with quick sketches, prioritizing must-have
                    features such as real-time site verification, testing ideas
                    for their user needs, and regulatory needs.

                    I started with creating hand-drawn wireframes to rapidly
                    visualize solutions, and allow the ideas to be shared with
                    stakeholders for review and feedback. After many iterations
                    and collaborative meetings, I created the wireframes of the
                    UI before moving to UI Design.

                      Designing for busy, low-tech users (e.g. engineers),
