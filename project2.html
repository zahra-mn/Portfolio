              <p class="lead">
                I worked as a Product Designer in Raha Consulting to lead an
                extremely sluggish, manual reporting method into a more
                efficient centralized, real-time executive dashboard. This was a
                collaboration, where Raha Consulting was working in conjunction
                with a large road construction supervision firm across the
                nation. The overall project aimed to resolve delays with
                executive decisions when they would try to reconcile what were
                critical project KPI's for their construction projects and
                assess if they fit into efficiencies and whether they were on
                track or ahead of budget.
                <br /><br />
                I did not design the actual UI, but I did sketch the initial
                wireframes, and worked closely with the UI designer to ensure
                the interface aligned with user experience and business
                priorities.

                There was a manual and distributed reporting, in the form of
                emails, WhatsApp, and Excel spreadsheets, which introduced
                delays of 3-5 days, and often produced incomplete or outdated
                reports. Because the reports were not systematically compiled
                into an overview, the CEO was unable to get a timely,
                centralized insight regarding performance, especially in
                discussions with government stakeholders.

                KPIs, ordered them based on how often we planned to gather the
                data, score in terms of importance, and whether we had the data
                available or not. This matrix guided us to a focus on the
                metrics that would deliver the most impact to the organization.
